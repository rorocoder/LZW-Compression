Hello, 

Here's my code. It should be working and accurate, if not let me know. The LZWCompression class inputs a file and first
uses the method fillInitialValues() to fill the HashMap dict with the pre-determined askii values for chars. 
It then calls the method compress which uses a buffered reader and a for loop to run through each char in the file. 
It adds combinations of these chars with arbitrary, decimal askii values to dict. The for loop also converts these 
decimals to binary before adding them to the string binaryString. binaryString is converted into a char array of 0s and 1s, 
which is then converted to a byte array, which is then used by the FileOutputStream to write a binary file.

The decoder does not work, I am unsure if it is an issue with the decoder or your encoder
It outputs something for file 1, but it is not right 
It gets an error for file 3
